I am from northern California.  A small town outside of Sacramento.
Compared to Bozeman however it's probably a large town. I moved here
two years ago to go to school and explore the mountains around the
area.  After a semester here I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  So
I took the next semester off to explore my interests and the
mountains.  Now I'm learning code and planning on going back to
school in the fall of this year.
